## 🚨 Quality Gates - Zero CI Failures

**Before committing, ALWAYS run:**
```bash
pixi run quality    # Tests + lint + typecheck - must pass
```

**If you get lint errors in CI:**
```bash
pixi run emergency-fix               # Quick fix: lint-fix + format + test
# OR
./scripts/fix-lint-violations.sh    # Guided emergency fix script
```

**Full quality workflow:**
```bash
pixi run quality           # Full quality check
pixi run lint-fix          # Auto-fix lint issues  
pixi run format            # Format code
git add . && git commit    # Pre-commit hooks run automatically
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Organization Setup (One-time - 15 minutes)

**Set up CI bot account and organization secrets:**

1. **Create dedicated GitHub account** (e.g., `ci-framework-bot`)
2. **Add to Claire-s-Monster organization** with write permissions
3. **Generate Personal Access Token** with `repo`, `workflow` scopes
4. **Create GPG key** for commit signing:
   ```bash
   # Generate GPG key (no passphrase for CI)
   gpg --full-generate-key
   
   # Export for GitHub secrets
   gpg --armor --export-secret-keys KEY_ID  # CI_BOT_GPG_KEY
   gpg --armor --export KEY_ID              # Add to bot's GitHub account
   ```

5. **Configure Organization Secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
   - `CI_BOT_TOKEN`: Personal access token
   - `CI_BOT_GPG_KEY`: Private GPG key (armored format)
   - `CI_BOT_GPG_KEY_ID`: GPG key ID
   - Set visibility to **"All repositories"**

### 2. Add to Any Repository (30 seconds)

Create `.github/workflows/ci-framework.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI Framework

# Required permissions for organization-wide automation  
permissions:
  contents: write        # Allow commits and branches
  pull-requests: write   # Allow PR creation/management
  issues: write         # Required for PR creation

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master, development]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master, development]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily maintenance
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  # Intelligent CI optimization

    with:
      security-level: 'medium'
    secrets: inherit

  # Cross-platform validation
  cross-platform:
    needs: change-detection
    if: needs.change-detection.outputs.skip-tests != 'true'
    uses: Claire-s-Monster/ci-framework/.github/workflows/cross-platform-validation.yml@v1.0.0

```

**That's it!** 🎉 Your repository now has enterprise-grade CI automation with intelligent optimization.

## 📋 Required Project Setup

### Minimum pyproject.toml Configuration

### Complete Repository Setup Checklist

For new repositories in the Claire-s-Monster organization:

#### ✅ **Required Files:**
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` with minimum pixi configuration (see above)
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci-framework.yml` ([Quick Start template](#quick-start))
- [ ] `.secrets.baseline` (generate with detect-secrets)
- [ ] `tests/` directory with pytest test files

#### ✅ **Quality Gate Verification:**
Before pushing to organization repositories, always run:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pixi install

# Run complete quality check
pixi run -e quality quality

# Verify all environments work
pixi list -e quality
pixi list -e quality-extended  # if used
```

#### ✅ **CI Integration Test:**
1. **Push to development branch** - Should trigger all CI workflows
2. **Check optimization** - Change detection should provide time savings
3. **Verify security** - Security scans should pass without critical issues
4. **Confirm performance** - Benchmarks should establish baseline
5. **Test cross-platform** - All platforms should validate successfully
6. **Verify cleanup** - Development artifacts removed from protected branches

### Workflow Dependencies

**The CI Framework expects these standardized pixi tasks:**

| Task Name | Required | Purpose | Command Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `lint` | ✅ Yes | Code linting | `ruff check .` |
| `lint-fix` | ✅ Yes | Auto-fix lint issues | `ruff check --fix . && ruff format .` |

| `quality` | ✅ Yes | Master quality task | `depends-on: ["lint", "typecheck", "test", "security"]` |

## 🏢 Complete Workflow Catalog

### Available Reusable Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| `change-detection.yml` | Smart CI optimization | detection-level, monorepo-mode | skip-tests, optimization-score |
| `quality-gates.yml` | Quality enforcement | tier, environment, fail-fast | success, quality-score |
| `performance-benchmark.yml` | Performance monitoring | suite, regression-threshold | regression-detected, trend-analysis |
| `security-scan.yml` | Security validation | security-level, enable-trivy | vulnerabilities-found, sarif-file |
| `self-healing.yml` | Automated CI fixes | healing-level, auto-fix, rollback | healed, rollback-triggered, fixes-applied |
| `cross-platform-validation.yml` | Platform testing | platforms, environments | platform-results, dependency-conflicts |
| `cleanup-dev-files.yml` | Repository hygiene | cleanup-patterns, target-branches | files-removed, cleanup-needed |

### Reusable Workflow Usage Patterns

The ci-framework provides two approaches for consuming reusable workflows:

#### Pattern 1: Remote Call (Recommended)

Call `reusable-ci.yml` directly from ci-framework - simplest setup, always up-to-date:

```yaml
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: Claire-s-Monster/ci-framework/.github/workflows/reusable-ci.yml@main
    with:
      pixi-environment: 'ci'
      python-versions: '["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]'
    secrets: inherit
```

#### Pattern 2: Local Copy (For Customization)

For repositories that want full control and local customization:

1. **Copy both files** to your repo's `.github/workflows/`:
   - `reusable-ci.yml` (the full CI pipeline)
   - `standalone-ci.yml` (simplified wrapper)

2. **Customize** the workflows locally as needed

3. **Call standalone-ci.yml** from your workflow:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     ci:
       uses: ./.github/workflows/standalone-ci.yml
       secrets: inherit
   ```

> **⚠️ Important**: `standalone-ci.yml` uses local path references and is designed as a **template for local use only**. Do not attempt to call it remotely - it will fail with `startup_failure`.

### Standalone Actions (for custom workflows)

| Action | Purpose | Location |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Change Detection | CI optimization | `./actions/change-detection` |
| Quality Gates | Quality validation | `./actions/quality-gates` |  
| Performance Benchmark | Performance testing | `./actions/performance-benchmark` |
| Security Scan | Security analysis | `./actions/security-scan` |
| Self-Healing | Automated CI fixes | `./actions/self-healing` |
| Cross-Platform Validation | Platform testing | `./actions/cross-platform-validation` |
| Cleanup Dev Files | Repository cleanup | `./actions/cleanup-dev-files` |
