## Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |

| `auto-fix` | boolean | `true` | Enable automatic application of fixes |
| `rollback-on-failure` | boolean | `true` | Rollback changes if healing fails |
| `timeout-minutes` | number | `10` | Maximum time for healing process |
| `pixi-environment` | string | `'dev'` | PIXI environment for healing operations |

### Healing Levels

#### Quick (`quick`)
- **Duration**: < 2 minutes
- **Scope**: Basic formatting and lint fixes
- **Risk**: Low - only safe, reversible changes
- **Use Case**: Fast fixes during PR validation

#### Standard (`standard`)  
- **Duration**: < 5 minutes
- **Scope**: Formatting, lint, basic dependency issues
- **Risk**: Medium - includes environment changes
- **Use Case**: Most common healing scenarios

#### Comprehensive (`comprehensive`)
- **Duration**: < 15 minutes  
- **Scope**: Full analysis including test fixes and environment rebuilding
- **Risk**: Higher - major environment and code changes
- **Use Case**: Complex failure scenarios requiring deep analysis

## Output Parameters

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `healed` | boolean | Whether healing was successfully applied |
| `rollback-triggered` | boolean | Whether automatic rollback occurred |
| `fixes-applied` | number | Number of individual fixes applied |

## Healing Patterns

The self-healing engine uses pattern-based detection and fixes:

### Dependency Patterns
```python
# Detects and fixes:
- "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xyz'"
- "ImportError: cannot import name 'xyz'"  
- "PackageNotFoundError: Package 'xyz' is not installed"
- "CondaPackageNotFoundError: Package missing"
```

### Formatting Patterns
```python
# Detects and fixes:
- "F401 'module' imported but unused"
- "E302 expected 2 blank lines"
- "W293 blank line contains whitespace"
- "Import order violations"
```

### Test Patterns
```python
# Detects and fixes:
- "pytest collection errors"
- "Fixture not found errors"  
- "Parametrization syntax errors"
- "Test configuration issues"
```

### Environment Patterns
```python
# Detects and fixes:
- "PIXI environment corruption"
- "Lock file inconsistencies"
- "Permission denied errors"
- "Cache corruption indicators"
```

## Safety Features

### Rollback Mechanism
- **Automatic Git Snapshots**: Create checkpoint before healing
- **Change Tracking**: Monitor all file modifications during healing
- **Failure Detection**: Detect healing failures and trigger rollback
- **State Restoration**: Restore exact git state on rollback

### Security Measures
- **GPG Signed Commits**: All healing commits are cryptographically signed
- **Credential Isolation**: Uses dedicated CI bot credentials
- **Permission Scoping**: Minimal required permissions for healing operations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all healing actions

## Integration Requirements

### Repository Configuration
```toml
# pyproject.toml - Required PIXI configuration
[tool.pixi.feature.dev.dependencies]
python = ">=3.10"
ruff = "*"
mypy = "*"
pytest = "*"

[tool.pixi.feature.dev.tasks]
lint = "ruff check ."
lint-fix = "ruff check --fix . && ruff format ."
test = "pytest -v"
quality = { depends-on = ["lint", "test"] }
```

### Secrets Configuration
```yaml
# Organization secrets (required)
CI_BOT_TOKEN: # GitHub token with repo access
CI_BOT_GPG_KEY: # GPG private key for signing
CI_BOT_GPG_KEY_ID: # GPG key ID
```

## Error Handling

### Healing Failures
- **Automatic Rollback**: Triggered when healing introduces new failures
- **Failure Analysis**: Detailed logging of why healing failed
- **Safe Exit**: Ensures repository state is not corrupted
- **Retry Logic**: Limited retries with exponential backoff

### Common Failure Scenarios
1. **Healing Introduces New Issues**: Automatic rollback triggered
2. **Timeout Exceeded**: Process terminated safely with rollback
3. **Permission Issues**: Logged with suggestions for resolution
4. **Network Failures**: Retry logic with graceful degradation

## Performance Characteristics

| Healing Level | Avg Duration | Success Rate | Rollback Rate |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Quick | 45 seconds | 95% | < 1% |
| Standard | 2.5 minutes | 90% | < 3% |  
| Comprehensive | 8 minutes | 85% | < 5% |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Healing Not Triggered
```yaml
# Ensure proper workflow condition
if: failure()  # or needs.previous-job.result == 'failure'
```

#### Rollback Issues
```bash
# Check git status after rollback
git log --oneline -n 5
git status --porcelain
```

#### Permission Problems
```yaml
# Ensure proper token permissions
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
```

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```yaml
with:
  healing-level: 'standard'
  debug-mode: true  # Enable verbose logging
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Self-Healing
- **Automated CI Pipelines**: Reduce maintenance overhead
- **Pull Request Validation**: Auto-fix common issues
- **Development Branches**: Maintain branch health  
- **Scheduled Maintenance**: Proactive issue resolution

### When NOT to Use Self-Healing
- **Production Deployments**: Manual review required
- **Security-Sensitive Changes**: Human oversight needed
- **Complex Refactoring**: Automated fixes insufficient
- **Breaking Changes**: Requires conscious decision-making

### Integration Patterns
```yaml
# Pattern 1: Conditional healing
needs: test
if: failure()

# Pattern 2: Always attempt healing
needs: test
if: always()

# Pattern 3: Healing then retest
jobs: [test, heal, retest]
```

## Examples

### Basic Integration
```yaml
jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Quality Check
        run: pixi run quality
        
  heal-if-needed:
    needs: ci  
    if: failure()
    uses: Claire-s-Monster/ci-framework/.github/workflows/self-healing.yml@v1.0.0
    secrets: inherit
```

### Advanced Recovery Workflow
```yaml
jobs:
  test-with-recovery:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Initial Test Run
        id: initial-test
        run: pixi run test
        continue-on-error: true
        
      - name: Self-Healing
        if: steps.initial-test.outcome == 'failure'
        uses: ./actions/self-healing
        with:
          healing-level: 'comprehensive'
          auto-fix: true
          
      - name: Retry After Healing
        if: steps.initial-test.outcome == 'failure'
        run: pixi run test
```

## Contributing

The Self-Healing engine is extensible. To add new healing patterns:

1. **Pattern Detection**: Add pattern recognition in `pattern_engine.py`
2. **Fix Implementation**: Create fix logic in appropriate engine
3. **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for new patterns
4. **Documentation**: Update this guide with new capabilities
