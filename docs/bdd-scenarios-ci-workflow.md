# BDD Scenarios - Python CI Workflow Template

**Task**: 2.1 - BDD Scenario Definition
**Methodology Step**: 1 - BDD Scenario Definition
**Date**: 2025-07-12

## 🎯 **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA OVERVIEW**

This document defines comprehensive BDD scenarios for the Python CI Workflow Template following the Integration-First BDD/TDD Hybrid methodology. All scenarios written in Gherkin format cover the 6 CI stages and their interactions.

## 🔄 **CI PIPELINE STAGES**

The workflow template implements a 6-stage pipeline:
1. **change-detection** → Identifies affected modules
2. **quick-checks** → Critical lint (F,E9), syntax validation (<2 min)
3. **comprehensive-tests** → Full test suite execution
4. **security-audit** → Safety, bandit, vulnerability scanning
5. **performance-check** → Benchmark execution and regression detection
6. **summary** → Consolidated reporting and artifact management

## 📋 **CORE BDD SCENARIOS**

### **Performance and Timing Requirements**

```gherkin
Feature: CI Performance Optimization

  Scenario: Quick checks meet timing requirements
    Given I have a Python project with the CI template
    When I make a small change affecting only one module
    Then quick checks should complete within 2 minutes
    And only critical lint violations (F,E9) should be checked
    And the result should be reported immediately via GitHub Status API

  Scenario: Full pipeline execution time reduction
    Given I have existing CI baseline metrics
    When I run the new CI workflow template
    Then total execution time should be reduced by 50% or more
    And parallel job execution should minimize wait times
    And intelligent caching should reduce redundant operations
```

### **Change Detection and Job Skipping**

```gherkin
Feature: Intelligent Change Detection

  Scenario: Documentation-only changes skip tests
    Given I have change detection configured
    When I modify only README.md or docs/ files
    Then comprehensive-tests stage should be skipped
    And security-audit stage should be skipped
    And performance-check stage should be skipped
    And only quick-checks and summary should execute

  Scenario: Python code changes trigger full pipeline
    Given I have change detection configured
    When I modify any .py file in src/ or framework/
    Then all 6 stages should execute
    And change detection should identify affected modules
    And test execution should focus on changed areas

  Scenario: Dependency changes force full validation
    Given I have change detection configured
    When I modify pyproject.toml or requirements files
    Then all stages must execute regardless of other changes
    And security audit should check new dependencies
    And performance benchmarks should validate impact
```

### **Matrix Testing Coverage**

```gherkin
Feature: Cross-Platform Matrix Testing

  Scenario: Complete Python version matrix
    Given I have matrix testing configured for Python CI
    When the workflow executes
    Then it should test all combinations:
      | Python Version | Operating System |
      | 3.10 | ubuntu-latest |
      | 3.10 | macos-latest |
      | 3.11 | ubuntu-latest |
      | 3.11 | macos-latest |
      | 3.12 | ubuntu-latest |
      | 3.12 | macos-latest |
    And all combinations should use consistent PIXI_VERSION
    And failure in any combination should fail the overall workflow

  Scenario: Matrix job isolation and parallelization
    Given I have matrix testing configured
    When multiple matrix jobs execute
    Then each job should run in isolated environment
    And jobs should execute in parallel when resources allow
    And job failures should not affect other matrix combinations
    And artifacts should be collected from all successful jobs
```

### **Security Integration and Reporting**

```gherkin
Feature: Comprehensive Security Scanning

  Scenario: Vulnerability detection and reporting
    Given I have security audit configured
    When the security stage executes
    Then it should run safety for dependency vulnerabilities
    And it should run bandit for code security issues
    And it should run pip-audit for package vulnerabilities
    And results should be consolidated in SARIF format
    And SARIF report should be uploaded to GitHub Security tab

  Scenario: Security failure handling
    Given I have security audit configured
    When security scan detects critical vulnerabilities
    Then the workflow should fail immediately
    And detailed vulnerability information should be reported
    And remediation suggestions should be provided
    And the failure should block deployment/merging
```

### **Performance Benchmarking and Regression Detection**

```gherkin
Feature: Performance Monitoring and Validation

  Scenario: Performance regression detection
    Given I have performance benchmarks configured
    When code changes result in >10% performance degradation
    Then the performance-check stage should fail
    And specific regression metrics should be reported
    And comparison to baseline should be detailed
    And recommendations for optimization should be provided

  Scenario: Performance improvement recognition
    Given I have performance benchmarks configured
    When code changes result in >5% performance improvement
    Then the improvement should be highlighted in summary
    And new baseline should be established
    And performance gains should be quantified
```

### **GitHub Status API Integration**

```gherkin
Feature: Real-time Status Reporting

  Scenario: Progressive status updates
    Given I have GitHub Status API integration configured
    When the CI workflow starts
    Then all stages should show "pending" status
    When each stage completes
    Then its status should update to "success" or "failure"
    And the commit status should reflect current progress
    And detailed logs should be linked from status

  Scenario: Final status consolidation
    Given all CI stages have completed
    When I view the final commit status
    Then it should reflect the worst outcome (failure overrides success)
    And the status description should summarize key results
    And links to detailed reports should be provided
```

### **Artifact Management and Summary Reporting**

```gherkin
Feature: Comprehensive Result Aggregation

  Scenario: Cross-stage artifact consolidation
    Given multiple stages generate reports and artifacts
    When the summary stage executes
    Then it should collect artifacts from all successful stages:
      - Test coverage reports from comprehensive-tests
      - Security scan results from security-audit
      - Performance benchmark data from performance-check
      - Lint reports from quick-checks
    And consolidated report should be generated
    And all artifacts should be downloadable from workflow summary

  Scenario: Summary report completeness
    Given all stages have completed execution
    When I view the summary report
    Then it should include:
      - Overall execution time
      - Per-stage timing breakdown
      - Test coverage percentage
      - Security vulnerability count
      - Performance comparison to baseline
      - Matrix testing results summary
    And report should be available in both human-readable and machine-readable formats
```

### **Environment and Configuration Consistency**

```gherkin
Feature: Environment Standardization

  Scenario: PIXI_VERSION consistency across jobs
    Given I have PIXI_VERSION environment variable configured
    When any stage in the workflow executes
    Then all jobs should use the same PIXI_VERSION
    And the version should be compatible with all Python versions in matrix
    And pixi installation should be cached for performance

  Scenario: Cross-project template adaptability
    Given I have the CI workflow template
    When I apply it to different project structures:
      - hb-strategy-sandbox (existing framework structure)
      - cheap-llm (MCP server structure)
      - pytest-analyzer (testing tool structure)
    Then the template should work without modifications
    And all acceptance criteria should be met across projects
    And performance should be acceptable for all project types
```
