"""Shared helpers for the meta-tests that inspect this repo's own build.

`test_yaml_lint_scope.py` (#274) and `test_workflow_lint_scope.py` (#279)
both answer the same shape of question - "does the gate named in
pyproject.toml actually cover what it claims, and does CI actually run it?"
- so they need the same three primitives: read `[tool.pixi.tasks]`, resolve
a task through its `pixi run -e <env> <impl>` indirection to the leaf
command, and scan `ci.yml`'s `run:` bodies for a task invocation.

Those primitives were duplicated in both files. They live here instead so a
fix in one is a fix in both.

These are meta-tests about the build system, so they parse `pixi` command
strings directly. If this project ever moves off pixi as its task runner,
this module is the single place that has to move with it - it will fail
loudly rather than pass vacuously, but the failure will point here rather
than at the real change.
