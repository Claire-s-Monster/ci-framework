"""Guards for the composite-action shellcheck gate (#261).

`actionlint` has no composite-action support and `yaml-lint` was scoped to
`.github/workflows/` by its own command, so the bash embedded in nine
`action.yml` files was checked by nothing at all. These tests guard the gate
that closed that hole - principally that its discovery cannot quietly narrow
to a subset, which is how #255's hand-maintained workflow list went stale
without anyone noticing.

They also pin the expression-neutralisation rules. Both naive substitutions
fabricate findings: a literal makes shellcheck evaluate a constant the runner
never produces (SC2050/SC2157), and a bare `$NAME` merges with a following
identifier character into a different variable (SC2034/SC2154). A fabricated
finding names the placeholder rather than anything in the source.

# build did not. Enforcement therefore lives in ci.yml's `action-shellcheck`
# step, which runs in `dev`; these tests are a second opinion, not the gate.
