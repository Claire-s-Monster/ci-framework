"""Guards against `./`-relative `uses:` refs in reusable workflows (#262).

Inside a workflow triggered by `workflow_call`, a `./`-relative `uses:` value
resolves against the CALLER's checkout, not this repo. Reusable workflows are
by definition only ever invoked by external consumers, so a `./`-relative
action reference in one can never resolve and is dead on arrival - it just
happens to go unnoticed because nothing in this repo's own CI calls its own
reusable workflows.

This guard is data-driven: it walks every workflow file and classifies it as
reusable by checking for `workflow_call` under `on:`, rather than hardcoding
which workflows are reusable. A hand-maintained list is exactly the kind of
thing that goes stale (#255, #261).
