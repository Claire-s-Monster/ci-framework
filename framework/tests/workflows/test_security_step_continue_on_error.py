"""Guard: no security-relevant step in a shipped workflow swallows its failure.

Issue #288: the "Run detect-secrets" step in `ci.yml`'s `security-scan` job
carried `continue-on-error: true` on top of a task that was already broken (its
`--exclude-files` arguments were shell globs, not regexes, so `detect-secrets
scan` raised `re.error` on every invocation and never actually completed a
scan). `continue-on-error: true` hid that: the step turned red in the logs but
green in the job result, so nothing failed CI and nothing forced a fix.

Issue #304 found that the guard written for that lesson had two blind spots,
and that a green run could not be told apart from a clean bill of health - it
reported "no security step is exempted" while 18 of them were:

  1. It walked only `ci.yml`. `standalone-ci.yml`, `reusable-ci.yml` and
     `reusable-security.yml` were outside its blast radius entirely. It now
     walks every file GitHub would actually run from `.github/workflows/`, and
     `test_anchor_workflows_each_yield_a_security_step` keeps that walk
     non-vacuous per file rather than only in aggregate.

  2. Its classifier recognised a scanner only when it was reached through a
     `pixi run <task>` indirection, so a step shelling straight out to
     `semgrep ci` or `npm audit`, or a `uses:` not on its marker list
     (`actions-rust-lang/audit`), was invisible to it. Several of #304's
     findings were exactly that shape; `DIRECT_SCANNER_RE` closes it.

What this guard does NOT assert is a blanket ban on `continue-on-error: true`
for security steps, which is what #304 assumed the fix would be. Both reusable
workflows pair each exempted scanner with a step that re-raises its failure:

    - name: TruffleHog scan
      id: trufflehog
      continue-on-error: true
    - name: Fail on verified secrets
      if: inputs.fail-on-secrets && steps.trufflehog.outcome == 'failure'
      run: exit 1

There the `continue-on-error: true` is load-bearing: it is precisely what makes
the `fail-on-secrets` input mean anything to a consumer. Stripping it would not
harden the scan, it would break a documented opt-out. So the real invariant,
asserted by `test_exempted_security_step_has_a_downstream_failure_gate`, is:

    a security-relevant step may carry `continue-on-error: true` only if some
    later step in the same job fails the job on its `outcome == 'failure'`

and, separately, that any such gate hanging off a `workflow_call` input has
that input defaulting to `true` - a gate defaulting to `false` is a scanner
that is advisory until a consumer opts in, which is #288's silence moved up one
level. `fail-on-sast` is exactly that - but it is a deliberate, permanent
exception rather than an open question: #305 decided to keep the default
`false` and document the tradeoff in `docs/security-scanning.md` instead of
changing it.

SARIF upload steps are classified as non-scanner infrastructure and are not
gated at all: an upload failing is a permissions or API problem, not a finding.
That classification is only honest while #306 - which suspects those uploads
have been failing silently in every job whose `permissions:` block omits
`security-events: write` - stays open and visible.

The two exemption maps below (`_KNOWN_UNGATED`, `_GATE_DEFAULTS_OFF`) are the
DOCUMENTED, tracked mechanism inherited from #290/#292/#301: every entry must
cite an issue, and `test_documented_exemptions_are_not_stale` forces deletion
once the entry's subject stops matching.

The pixi-manifest and workflow parsing primitives live in
`framework/tests/utils/pixi_meta.py`, shared with `test_yaml_lint_scope.py`,
`test_workflow_lint_scope.py` and `test_pre_commit_ci_gate.py`.
