"""Guards that a CI quality gate cannot silently discard its exit code.

Issue #278: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` ran

    pixi run -e quality typecheck || echo "Type check completed with issues"

The `|| echo` made the step exit 0 whatever mypy returned, so a type error
could not fail CI - while `pixi run quality`, which hard-depends on
`typecheck`, failed locally. CI was strictly weaker than the local gate it
is supposed to mirror, and the green check read as though it were not.

The rule lives in `framework.workflow_lint` (`swallowed-gate-exit`) rather
than in a ci.yml-specific test, so it covers every file
`discover_workflow_files` finds (#279).

These tests deliberately keep the pre-fix shape as a synthetic fixture. A
guard that only ever sees an already-clean tree passes vacuously - the #281
review found exactly that failure mode in a first-draft classifier - so
every "does not fire" case here is paired with a sample the rule MUST
reject.
