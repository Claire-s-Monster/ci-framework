"""Tests guarding the scope and CI wiring of the `yaml-lint` pixi task.

Issue #274: `yaml-lint` (`yamllint .github/workflows/`) only covers the
top-level workflow YAML files, leaving every composite `action.yml`/
`action.yaml` in the repo unlinted by yamllint. Worse, no CI job invokes
`yaml-lint` at all, so it cannot fail even for the files it does cover.

This is the #255-shaped guard: derive the actually-linted paths and the
actually-shipped YAML universe from the manifest/filesystem themselves,
rather than hand-listing "the files this covers", so a future narrowing of
scope (or a dropped CI invocation) fails a test instead of silently
shipping unlinted YAML.
