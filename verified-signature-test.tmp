Test file for verified GPG signature cleanup workflow

This file should trigger the cleanup workflow which will now create
commits with VERIFIED signatures since the public GPG key has been
added to the ci-framework-bot GitHub account.

Expected outcome:
- ci-framework-bot creates cleanup PR
- Commits show as "Verified" with green checkmark
- Auto-merge works without signature blocking
